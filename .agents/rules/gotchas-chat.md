# Chat / Rovo Gotchas

- **Hybrid AI Gateway/Rovo mode**: `pnpm run dev` starts backend + frontend and supports AI Gateway-backed chat when credentials are configured. `pnpm run rovo` adds Rovo Serve (single-instance default; use `pnpm run rovo -- 6` for full pool). Use vanilla `portless run` when you want stable `.localhost` URLs — bare for the main checkout and branched worktrees (the branch is auto-prepended), `--name <worktree-dir>` only when detached, and `--script rovo` only when the surface needs Rovo Serve. Requests that explicitly select Rovo return 503 when Rovo Serve is unavailable.
- **Staging CloudID**: AI Gateway staging now rejects tenant UUIDs and `local-testing`. VPK remaps those to `internal-dummy-<use-case-id>` (the same dummy CloudID Proximity uses). Keep a real CloudID only for production gateway URLs, or set `AI_GATEWAY_CLOUD_ID=internal-dummy-<use-case-id>` in `.env.local`.
- If the chat gives unexpected answers or stale context, the Rovo session may be corrupted — restart `pnpm run rovo` for a fresh session.
- Always `await stop()` before calling `sendMessage()` in AI SDK `useChat` flows — `stop`, `sendMessage`, `regenerate`, and `resumeStream` share mutable internal state and must not be fire-and-forgotten in sequence.
- Frontend message deletion (`handleDeleteMessage`) does not clear Rovo Serve's server-side conversation history. After deleting messages, Rovo-selected turns may still reference prior context. Restart `pnpm run rovo` for a full Rovo reset.
