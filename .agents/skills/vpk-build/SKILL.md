description: Extract a VPK route into a standalone, minimal Next.js app with traced imports, source-compatible paths, and Micros-ready scaffolding. Use when asked to invoke vpk-build, extract a route, create a standalone prototype, or hand a VPK route off as an independently deployable app.

# VPK build

Turn one `app/<route>` surface into a sibling Next.js project whose source tree
mirrors VPK, whose dependencies come from the traced import graph, and whose
deployment handoff is compatible with `vpk-deploy`.

## When to use

Use this skill when a route needs its own URL, repository-sized deliverable, or
independent deployment. Keep work in VPK while composing across routes or
depending on shared runtime infrastructure that has no explicit export plan.
This workflow extracts one route at a time and does not invent replacement
backend behavior.

## Hard invariants

- Run the trace before scaffolding and inspect every warning or decision point.
- Ask for confirmation after the read-only plan and before creating the sibling
  target.
- Preserve repo-relative source paths and copy source files verbatim where
  possible; put extraction-specific behavior in the target harness.
- Copy the full `public/` tree because runtime data can reference untraced assets.
- Resolve `catalog:` against the source `pnpm-workspace.yaml` catalog when
  writing the target `package.json`. The sibling is not a pnpm workspace.
- Copy the source token-free `.npmrc` so `@atlassian/*` registry routing works.
- Always keep `shadcn` (dep + CSS), like `tw-animate-css`. Never strip its
  import; rewrite `@import "shadcn/tailwind.css"` to
  `@import "../node_modules/shadcn/dist/tailwind.css";`.
- Copy every local `cssImports` path and local `@import "./…"` files from the
  generated `globals.css`.
- Copy ambient `types/*.d.ts`, sibling `*.d.ts` next to copied `.js`, a
  minimal `next-env.d.ts` (no `.next/dev` imports), and
  `types/jsx-namespace.d.ts` for React 19 `JSX.Element`.
- Import `getThemeStyles` from `@atlaskit/tokens/get-theme-styles`. Skip
  providers whose required props are not children-only
  (`WorkItemModalProvider` at minimum).
- Set `allowedDevOrigins: ["127.0.2.2", "localhost"]` in generated
  `next.config`. Preview via `http://localhost:3001`.
- Do not treat a successful static build as proof that API, SSE, WebSocket,
  realtime, AI, voice, or scripted-tour behavior works.
- After `verify-target.sh`, inspect computed layout in a real viewport. Jira
  header tabs must be `flex-direction: column` when `data-horizontal`.
- Do not create fake local API shims unless the user explicitly requests a mock.
- Keep the script filenames and paths in this skill. Encode extraction-contract
  fixes in those scripts and their tests, not as one-off target edits.

## Interface

```text
/vpk-build /<route>                 # target: sibling vpk-<route>
/vpk-build /<route> <custom-name>   # custom target directory
```

Read [extraction guide](references/extraction-guide.md) for route discovery,
backend-backed export requirements, generated CSS/runtime behavior, failure
diagnosis, ports, and the deployment handoff.

## Workflow

### 1. Plan (read-only)

Trace the route and write the plan under the skill-local cache:

```bash
node .agents/skills/vpk-build/scripts/trace-imports.mjs <route-path> \
  --out .agents/skills/vpk-build/.cache/<route-slug>.plan.json
```

Review file, package, asset, backend-route, dynamic-import, cross-route-link,
and skipped-dispatcher findings. Stop for a decision when:

- backend routes are present but no backend-backed export was requested;
- a dynamic import is not statically resolvable;
- dependencies or graph edges remain unresolved;
- the plan would trim live VPK behavior to a static presentation shell.

For an intentional Studio/chat/Rovo/wiki/realtime export, use the full
backend-backed contract in [extraction guide](references/extraction-guide.md).
Show the plan summary and receive confirmation before continuing.

### 2. Scaffold and copy

```bash
node .agents/skills/vpk-build/scripts/scaffold-target.mjs \
  .agents/skills/vpk-build/.cache/<route-slug>.plan.json \
  [--target <custom-dir>] [--force]
```

The script creates the sibling project, preserves repo-relative paths, copies
planned source plus `public`, local CSS, ambient `.d.ts`, and `.npmrc`, resolves
`catalog:` versions, rewrites the route entry to its direct demo import,
generates the provider/layout harness (skipping unsafe providers), keeps
always-on `shadcn` CSS, adds the Micros scaffold, initializes Git, and wires
only the approved setup and deploy skills.

Static scaffold inputs live under [scaffold references](references/scaffold/).
Micros templates live under [Micros references](references/micros/). Do not edit
the source route to compensate for an extraction-only concern.

### 3. Verify the target

```bash
.agents/skills/vpk-build/scripts/verify-target.sh <target-dir>
```

This runs install, typecheck, and build in the extracted project. Resolve
failures at their owner: dependency versions in target `package.json`, missing
graph edges in the plan/trace, source parity in copied files, and CSS/runtime
setup in the generated harness. If a copied CSS file exists and the bundler
still cannot resolve it, delete the target `.next` cache and rebuild. Then run
the extracted app at `http://localhost:3001` and verify the real route, assets,
console, computed layout (not only an a11y snapshot), and every required
interaction.

Backend-backed extracts must also prove the source backend starts, API proxies
work, `/api/realtime/ws-url` resolves correctly, WebSocket upgrades succeed,
and copied behavior remains source-compatible.

### 4. Hand off deployment

After verification passes, enter the sibling project and invoke
`vpk-deploy --initial`. Subsequent deployments use `pnpm run deploy:micros` once
`.deploy.local` exists. Use the full backend deployment shape for any app with
live API, SSE, or WebSocket dependencies.

## Validation

When changing this skill's documentation or extraction contract, run:

```bash
node --test .agents/skills/vpk-build/scripts/*.test.js
```

For an actual extraction, the required proof is a passing `verify-target.sh`
run plus live browser verification of the extracted route, including computed
layout in a headed/narrow viewport. Successful typecheck/build can still hide
missing `shadcn` variants.
