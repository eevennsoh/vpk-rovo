# Review gate

Run this gate before every merge, including merge-back of an existing PR. The
required `CI / PR checks` status is protected on `main`; auto-merge waits for it.
GitHub also blocks unresolved conversations. Never use `--admin` to bypass
checks or conversation resolution.

## Codex auto-review status

After creating or updating a PR, capture its current head and update time:

```bash
gh pr view <number> --json headRefOid,updatedAt,reviews,url
```

When this run pushed the head and the user did not request `--bypass`, poll for
up to three minutes at 15-second intervals for a terminal Codex signal:

- a `chatgpt-codex-connector` review tied to the current head;
- a current-head `+1` reaction, meaning reviewed with no findings;
- `eyes`, meaning still in progress.

Ignore stale-head signals and keep polling until the timeout. A timeout, missing
credit, auth problem, outage, or explicit bypass is non-blocking: record the
status and continue. Do not post `@codex review`; automatic review is already
configured and a manual mention can duplicate it. For an existing PR whose head
was not pushed in this run, inspect current status without waiting.

## Fetch every review surface

Run the repo-owned read-only status helper from the VPK checkout:

```bash
node .agents/skills/vpk-git-ship/scripts/review-gate-status.js \
  --pr <number> --repo <owner>/<repo> --json
```

The helper captures the current head and check rollup, pages GraphQL
`reviewThreads` until `hasNextPage` is false, fetches paginated REST comments and
reviews, and maps every top-level REST comment to a GraphQL thread by database
ID. When GraphQL temporarily omits a REST comment, it re-fetches every surface
at five-second intervals for up to 30 seconds. Its JSON is the rerunnable review
artifact; do not replace it with an ad-hoc partial query.

Inspect `unresolvedThreads`, `missingRestCommentIds`, and
`nonApprovingReviews`. Classify every listed non-approving review using its ID
and the current PR before proceeding; the helper cannot decide product judgment.
Only declare the review gate clear when `reviewGateClear` is true and those
reviews are classified. Older-commit conversations still block when unresolved.
`mergeStateStatus: CLEAN` and passing checks are separate supporting evidence.

Immediately before merge, add `--require-clear`. Exit 2 means at least one
review, check, or merge-state condition remains; inspect the same JSON rather
than weakening the gate. An API/schema failure exits 1. If a REST comment stays
missing after the bounded retries, or any surface cannot be fetched, stop and
report its ID. Do not use scraped HTML, undocumented endpoints, or browser
automation to manufacture a thread ID.

## Classify and remediate

Classify every unresolved thread, regardless of reviewer:

- **Valid:** a real bug, contract gap, missing test, incorrect visual state, or
  clarity issue. Make the smallest source fix, run focused validation, commit,
  and push.
- **Invalid or already handled:** current source or a newer diff proves the
  concern no longer applies. Do not change code; reply with specific evidence.
- **Ambiguous or product judgment:** stop before merge and report the URL and
  decision needed. Do not resolve it.

Every resolved conversation needs a visible disposition first:

```text
Fixed in <commit>; validation: <check/result>.
No code change: <specific evidence/rationale>.
```

Reply through the documented mutation:

```bash
gh api graphql -f threadId="<PRRT-id>" -f body="<reply>" \
  -f query='mutation($threadId:ID!,$body:String!){
    addPullRequestReviewThreadReply(input:{
      pullRequestReviewThreadId:$threadId,body:$body
    }){comment{url}}
  }'
```

A reply is not a resolution. Resolve only after the disposition exists:

```bash
gh api graphql -f threadId="<PRRT-id>" \
  -f query='mutation($threadId:ID!){
    resolveReviewThread(input:{threadId:$threadId}){thread{id isResolved}}
  }'
```

The mutation requires the GraphQL `PRRT_...` ID, not a REST comment ID. Re-fetch
all pages and REST surfaces afterward. Continue only when every handled thread
returns `isResolved: true`, no unresolved thread remains, and required checks
are passing or pending under auto-merge.

## Failure and re-review cases

- If a remediation push changes the head, re-check required checks and repeat
  the full review-surface reconciliation. A reviewer may create new threads.
- If GitHub dismisses or re-requests review after the push, treat that as current
  state; do not reuse approval evidence from the old head.
- If APIs cannot fetch, reply, resolve, or verify a thread, stop before merge.
- If `BLOCKED` or `UNKNOWN` persists while checks are green, reconcile GraphQL
  and REST again before attributing it to CODEOWNERS or another ruleset.
- Never resolve silently, resolve first and fix later, or treat a posted reply
  as a cleared conversation.
