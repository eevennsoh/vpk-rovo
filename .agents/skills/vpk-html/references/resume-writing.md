# Resume Writing

Resume-specific quality bar. Use alongside `references/writing.md` (which has
the general prose rules).

## The bullet template

Every bullet on a resume should answer four questions:

```
[Action] + [Scope] + [Result] + [Business Outcome]
```

| Slot | What it answers | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| Action | What you did | Led, built, migrated, designed, owned, shipped |
| Scope | How big it was | 3-person team, 142 tables, 1.8 TB dataset, 12 services |
| Result | What measurable thing changed | 47-minute cutover, p99 from 480ms to 312ms, 0 mismatches |
| Business Outcome | Why anyone outside engineering should care | Saved $48k/mo, unblocked Q3 launch, eliminated SEV-1s in checkout |

A bullet that has only Action + Scope is a job description.
A bullet that adds Result is a story.
A bullet that adds Business Outcome is a hire signal.

### Bad

> Worked on database performance improvements.

(Action only. No scope, no result, no outcome.)

### Better

> Improved Postgres performance via index tuning and query rewrites.

(Action + Scope. Still no result.)

### Good

> Reduced p99 query latency from 480ms to 312ms across 142 tables by adding
> 14 composite indexes and rewriting 8 hot-path queries.

(Action + Scope + Result.)

### Great

> Reduced p99 query latency from 480ms to 312ms across 142 tables by adding
> 14 composite indexes and rewriting 8 hot-path queries — unblocking the Q2
> checkout redesign that had been waiting on database headroom.

(Action + Scope + Result + Business Outcome.)

## Verbs that pull weight

Strong verbs lead with capability. Weak verbs leak passivity.

| Use | Avoid | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Built, shipped, designed | Helped build, contributed to | "Helped" is everyone's hedge. If you owned it, say so. |
| Led, owned | Was responsible for | Owning is binary; "responsible for" is a fig leaf. |
| Reduced, increased, eliminated | Improved, optimized | Movement verbs imply measurement. |
| Migrated, replaced, deprecated | Worked on | "Worked on" can mean anything from architect to interim resource. |
| Authored, defined | Helped draft, participated in | Authorship is a strong claim — use it where you can defend it. |

> If you can't substitute a stronger verb, the bullet probably isn't a story
> worth telling. Move it down or cut.

## What to quantify

The reader's question is always "how big?" Answer it before they ask.

| Easy to quantify | Example numbers |
|---|---|
| Team size | "3-person team", "team of 12" |
| Scope | "142 tables", "8 services", "24,000 users" |
| Duration | "delivered in 6 weeks", "47-minute cutover" |
| Performance | "p99 dropped 35%", "throughput up 4x" |
| Cost | "$48k/mo saved", "$576k annualized" |
| Risk reduction | "0 incidents in 90 days", "eliminated SEV-1s in module X" |

Where exact numbers aren't available, use ranges or magnitudes ("dozens of",
"≈30 services") — but only when ranges are genuinely all you have. A vague
number is better than a fabricated specific.

## Bullet ordering inside a role

Order bullets by *impact*, not chronology. The first bullet of a role should
be the most senior, highest-impact thing you did. The reader may stop after
two bullets — make sure those two are the strongest.

| Position | What goes there |
|---|---|
| Bullet 1 | The headline accomplishment of the role |
| Bullet 2 | The second-strongest thing — often a complementary axis (e.g., shipped + scaled, built + hired) |
| Bullet 3 | Either a third major win or a notable side-effort |
| Bullets 4-5 | Optional — only if they add a distinct dimension |

Five bullets per role is the practical maximum. More dilutes; fewer is fine.

## Role headers

Each role needs: title, company, dates, location (optional, omit if remote).

```
Staff Software Engineer · Acme Corp · 2023 – 2026
Lead engineer for the Platform team. Owned the API tier, capacity, and
on-call rotation across 12 tier-0 services.
```

The one-line role summary directly under the header (the "what was the job")
is optional but helpful when the role doesn't telegraph itself from the title.

## Section ordering

Standard order, top to bottom:

1. Name + contact (one line each)
2. Optional: a 2-3 sentence summary, only if the candidate's positioning is
   non-obvious (e.g., switching specialties, returning to engineering)
3. Experience (reverse chronological)
4. Education (concise; one line per degree unless the degree is the most
   recent thing)
5. Selected projects / open-source (optional; only if any project has bullets
   as strong as the experience section)
6. Skills (optional; flat list, no proficiency bars)

What does *not* belong on a resume:

- "Objective" sections that say "looking for challenging role"
- Headshots
- Pie charts of skill proficiency
- Soft skills as bullets ("team player", "good communicator")
- References — "available on request" implies you're hiding something. Just
  omit.

## Length

- 0–8 years: one page.
- 8+ years: one or two pages.
- 15+ years or staff/principal candidates: two pages is acceptable; three is
  almost always padding.

If you can't fit it on one page and you have 0-8 years of experience, the
issue is bullet quality (probably too much Action+Scope, not enough Result).

## Common AI-generated failure modes

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| Every bullet starts with "Helped" or "Collaborated with" | Replace with strong verbs. Hedging is the AI default. |
| Numbers are suspiciously round (10%, 50%, 100x) | These read as fabricated. Use real numbers — "47-minute cutover", not "1-hour cutover". |
| Bullets describe responsibilities, not accomplishments | A responsibility is "ongoing thing you did." An accomplishment is "a thing that finished." Most bullets should be accomplishments. |
| Five identical-shape bullets per role | Vary the shape. Some are migrations (one big effort), some are processes (recurring work), some are mentorship/hiring (people work). |
| Buzzword soup ("cross-functional, agile, customer-centric") | Cut. The hiring manager reads these as filler and skips ahead. |

## Quality check

Before shipping, read each bullet aloud and ask:

1. Could I defend this number in an interview?
2. Could another engineer at my company have written this exact bullet?
   (If yes, it's not specific enough.)
3. Does it pass the "so what?" test — would a hiring manager care?

If any bullet fails all three, cut or rewrite.
