		"The `/jira-golden-journeys-v0` queue session flyout, presented as one compact chat-history list. Every row feeds one shared, anchored flyout viewport, so hovering vertically between sessions moves and resizes the popup while its content crossfades. The default demo is the session-details hover card. Separate catalog examples cover the Agent States composer, an untracked-work suggestion, and a coding-lifecycle walkthrough. By default the block renders the four `/jira-golden-journeys-v0` sessions — awaiting user response, in progress, PR open, and PR merged.",
