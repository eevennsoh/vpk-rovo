		'Agent sessions in four footprints and relationship states. Large is the default detached, solid uncaptured-work card, and it comes in two densities: `short` leads with a 32px identity and a `agent · host · time` byline, while `long` drops the leading avatar, gives the title its own line, and spends the room on `agent · host · artifact · timestamp` plus a trailing lifecycle label and icon. Progression stays at the far right, not in the byline; Working shimmers while Needs input and Finished remain still. Owner rows reveal a `…` menu; viewer rows show an outline information-circle tooltip instead; expired cloud-long rows show an X because history is only kept for 28 days. A local owner menu offers Continue in — the agent itself or Terminal — while a cloud owner menu offers Rename and Delete. Both end in a dismiss row. Medium detached is a 276px stroked white chip (Jira issue width, 10px corners): 24px agent+human identity, the session title, and a trailing up-arrow key, still with the untracked-work flyout. Medium attached is the Jira Issue activity row (24px identity, h-10 chin, trailing 24×24 status) already connected to work. Small becomes the collapsed Agent Session Column notch. Short, medium, and small detached footprints open the untracked-work Agent Session Flyout with Link, Create, and add-as-subtask actions; long density does not. Medium attached opens session details because its Jira relationship already exists. Captured ids use a solid border, and rows the host cannot resume disable the Terminal row.',
