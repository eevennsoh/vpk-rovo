 * as one connected surface being pushed rather than a single mark lighting up.
 *
 * Declared here rather than imported from Pulse, because a shared block must not
 * reach into a kanban variant's internals — the same trade the collapsed column
 * already makes for its 32px width. Pure on purpose: this is the half a test can
 * execute without a React tree behind it, and keeping it out of the component
 * file is also what keeps Fast Refresh working in the mark.
