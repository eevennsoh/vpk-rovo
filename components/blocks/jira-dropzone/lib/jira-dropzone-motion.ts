/**
 * Shared flight recipe for create-well and card-link drops.
 *
 * Default travel is a straight tween — the Team EU26 board drop. `durationMs`
 * is duration-slower so a button-launched catalog drop can still be tracked;
 * on the board the pointer is already on the well, so the same budget is a
 * short slide to centre. Arc path, peak, rotate, and strength stay on the
 * profile so a catalog or host override can opt back into Motion `arc()`
 * without re-seeding the rest of the recipe. `staggerMs` is duration-normal
 * so each chip is visibly queued before the next leaves. `launchSpreadPx` is
 * space.600 so ~80px mention chips fan into a pack instead of overlapping at
 * 14px.
