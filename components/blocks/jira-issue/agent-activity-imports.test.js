/**
 * Import contract for the aggregate agent activity row.
 *
 * The row draws its own avatars through `AgentAvatarVisual`, so it must not
 * pull agent-list or agent-states *components* into the Jira Issue bundle.
 *
 * The guard reads value imports alone. Type-only specifiers erase at build
 * time and cost nothing, so barring them would police spelling rather than
 * bundle weight — and it would break the moment a shared model needs a type
 * from those barrels, which is exactly what `invokedBy: AgentListInvoker` does.
 *
 * Split out of `jira-issue.test.js`, which sits at the 1000-line file budget.
