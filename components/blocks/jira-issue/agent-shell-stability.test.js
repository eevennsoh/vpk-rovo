/**
 * Contract for the agent shell's tree shape.
 *
 * `JiraIssue` returns two structurally different trees, and which one it picks
 * turns on two switches that sit on the article's *first child*. A React
 * element-type change there tears down the whole card subtree, so a card that
 * never left the screen remounts: keyboard focus is lost, and every
 * mount-animated descendant replays its entrance — the assignee `Avatar`'s
 * `initial: { scale: 0.8, opacity: 0 }` most visibly, because a remount is
 * indistinguishable from a genuine arrival.
 *
 * A board filter flips both switches at once. `applyCardAgentSessionVisibility`
 * strips `agentActivities` / `agentActivityMode` off the cards it is not
 * focusing, and `agentSessionTransfer` needs a non-completed activity, so the
 * last unlinkable row takes the transfer host with it. Neither has anything to
 * do with the card itself, which is why the shape must not follow them.
 *
 * These assertions live in their own file because `jira-issue.test.js` is at
 * the 1000-line architecture budget.
