 * How one card should play a live arrival.
 *
 * Every arriving card runs the same jira-creating entrance. A create-well drop
 * and a mid-column gap drop mint the same work item, so they must land the same
 * way — the seam a gap drop opens is exactly the `height: 0 -> auto` slot the
 * create entrance already animates.
 *
 * `appended` therefore no longer picks an entrance. It stays a scroll concern
 * (a gap drop lands under the pointer and must not yank the column) and it
 * does not affect the card's appearance.
