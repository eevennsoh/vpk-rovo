 * Two exports rather than one, because the anchor and the paint live on
 * different owners:
 *
 * - `getBoardCardInsertionAnchorClassName` returns `relative` for the card
 *   wrapper. The wrapper is a flex item in the column stack and is NOT
 *   positioned at rest, so an absolutely positioned child would otherwise
 *   escape to some far ancestor. Shipping `relative` only while the line shows
 *   keeps every other card's paint order untouched.
 * - `BoardCardInsertionLine` is the line itself. It is absolutely positioned,
 *   so it adds no flex child, consumes no `gap` track, and changes no card's
 *   size — the gesture must show where the card *will* go without moving
 *   anything that is already on the board.
 *
 * Both are driven by the same `position`, so the wiring agent computes it once
 * per card and passes it to both.

 *   between the cards rather than to either one of them. Every seam a card can
 *   own is this one; a column's outer edges get no seam.
 * - `edge` — the stand-in seam of a column that holds no cards, drawn flush at
 *   the top of the empty card list. There is no gap track to centre in, only
 *   the card list's own boundary, and the list stays a real scrollport for the
 *   whole gesture (dropping `overflow-y-auto` would make the browser discard
 *   its scroll offset and jump every scrolled column to its first card). The
 *   "+" marker is `position: fixed` and CSS-anchored so it can straddle the
 *   card list's left edge without being clipped by the scrollport.
