/**
 * Pulse scope — narrowing the article to one epic or one sprint.
 *
 * The scope brief draws two things a reader will act on: a percentage and a
 * burndown. Both are arithmetic, and both are the kind of arithmetic that goes
 * quietly wrong — three bands that round to 99 leave a hairline of empty track
 * where the bar should have closed, and a burndown whose guideline is drawn
 * from the wrong origin tells a lead the sprint is fine when it is not.
 *
 * So the arithmetic is pure, lives in `lib/`, and is executed here rather than
 * grepped. The fixture is checked against the real timeline too: a scope whose
 * work items do not exist would narrow the article to an empty page, and that
 * failure is invisible in a screenshot of the brief itself.
