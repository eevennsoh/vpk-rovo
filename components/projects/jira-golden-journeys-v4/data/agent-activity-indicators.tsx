/**
 * Team EU's working chin uses the explicit experimental six-dot iconic orb
 * from the Jira prototype. The two departures are the outcome glyphs.
 * Awaiting-input: a question circle says the agent is blocked on an answer,
 * which a neutral status dot does not. Finished: the filled success status
 * names the outcome and pairs with the filled error status a failed run
 * already shows, where the block's neutral dot only said "this row ended".
 *
 * The renderer prop is all-or-nothing — one function covers every state — so
 * the working case names that opt-in treatment directly while the shared
 * spinner's neutral default remains unchanged.
 *
 * The filled question circle lives in `@atlaskit/icon-lab`, not `@atlaskit/icon`
 * — it is the design system's only filled question glyph, and it first ships in
 * icon-lab 7.8.0. It takes the information color the block's awaiting-input
 * default uses. ADS icons need the `color` prop rather than a Tailwind class:
 * `@atlaskit/icon` ships Compiled CSS unlayered, and unlayered rules outrank
 * anything in `@layer utilities` regardless of specificity. That applies to the
 * success green here too.
