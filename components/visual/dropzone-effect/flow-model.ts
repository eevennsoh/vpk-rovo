/**
 * The river, as pure math.
 *
 * A sticker's whole journey is a closed-form function of one number: `u`, its
 * normalised progress from spawn to swallowed. Nothing is integrated frame to
 * frame, so the motion cannot drift, cannot explode, is identical at any frame
 * rate, and is trivially testable off-screen.
 *
 * The path is a log spiral into the orb, the shape the reference uses for its
 * drain:
 *
 *   r(u)     = r0 * (1 - (LEAN*u + (1 - LEAN)*u^JET))   a lean, then a jet
 *   theta(u) = theta0 + w * ln(r0 / r)                  same sign for everyone
 *
 * `ln(r0 / r)` is near zero for most of the run and blows up in the last few
 * percent, which is exactly the behaviour we want: a long graceful drift, then
 * a sudden twist into the drain.
