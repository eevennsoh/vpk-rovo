/**
 * The deep field the river runs across.
 *
 * A single `THREE.Points` slab between `starDepthFar` and `starDepthNear`, all
 * of it behind the orb's focal plane. Points, not quads: a star is a point
 * source with nothing to orient, and one draw call carries all 1,400 of them.
 *
 * Two details do the heavy lifting. The slab is genuinely deep, so `x`/`y` have
 * to widen with distance or its far half would only fill the middle of the
 * frame. And `gl_PointSize` is driven by perspective, so a far star really is
 * smaller — which means most of them land under a pixel, where the fix is to
 * hold the sprite at ~1 px and pay the lost area back in brightness. Snapping
 * sub-pixel sprites up without that compensation is what turns a starfield into
 * a shimmering mess the moment anything moves.
