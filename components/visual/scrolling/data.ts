/**
 * Payments-codebase sessions for the looping scroller.
 *
 * Three deliberate constraints, all of them load-bearing:
 *
 * 1. **Every row sets `timeLabel`.** Without it `AgentListTime` falls through to
 *    `Date.now()` and can mount a live one-second `ElapsedTime` per row — an
 *    SSR/client hydration mismatch multiplied by every loop clone.
 * 2. **No row sets `summary`.** A summary switches the row to `items-start` and
 *    adds 28px+, giving ragged card heights; omitting it keeps every card at a
 *    uniform 62px so the fixed gap and the deck-collapse maths stay symmetric.
 * 3. **Mostly `state: "complete"`.** `running` mounts a `PixelLoader` and
 *    `needs-input` mounts a title `Shimmer` plus `AnimatedDots`; one of each is
 *    enough variety without N x (1 + cloneCount) animated subtrees competing
 *    with the entrance spring.
 * 4. **One avatar and one machine per person.** All eight cards are on screen at
 *    once and the loop shows each of them repeatedly, so a person appearing with
 *    two different avatars — or borrowing someone else's laptop name — reads as a
 *    rendering bug rather than as fixture noise. Andrew Park and Chloe Lee are
 *    each invoked twice; keep their `invokedBy.avatarSrc` and `machineName`
 *    identical across both rows.
