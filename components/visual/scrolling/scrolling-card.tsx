	// motion-dom 13 never reads. That form collected only `collapse` (a motion
	// 13 value), so the depth tail recomputed during the entrance and then
	// FROZE: cards kept the scale they happened to have when the unfurl ended,
	// no matter where they later scrolled to. Verified in-browser — after a
	// 280px drag every scale was byte-identical while the cards had moved a
	// third of the scrollport, and a forced React re-render snapped them all to
