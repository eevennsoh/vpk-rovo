/**
 * Pure layout geometry for the Scrolling ticker's configurable deck behaviours.
 *
 * Three independent knobs live here, all of them plain functions so
 * `stack-layout.test.ts` can exercise them under `node --test`:
 *
 * 1. **Entrance origin** — where the collapsed deck sits before it unfurls
 *    ({@link fanAnchor}), and which DOM copies of an item join the unfurl at all
 *    ({@link fanSlack}, {@link fansIn}).
 * 2. **Stacking order** — which card paints on top while cards overlap
 *    ({@link stackZIndex}), derived from the card's live place in the loop
 *    ({@link cardLoopPositionFrom}) rather than from its static index.
 * 3. **Depth tail** — the gradual scale-and-tuck applied to cards approaching an
 *    edge of the scrollport ({@link depthProgress}, {@link depthScale},
 *    {@link depthLift}).
 *
 * ## Why every function is total
 *
 * Same hazard as `lib.ts`: these results are written straight into Motion
 * `MotionValue`s, and a single non-finite frame PERMANENTLY poisons one — once
 * `NaN` lands, every later read derives from the poisoned value and stays `NaN`
 * for the lifetime of the value, silently.
 *
 * The inputs really are untrustworthy. motion-plus' Ticker reports
 * `{ start: 0, end: 0 }` per item and `containerLength: 0` until it has
 * measured, and `useTickerItem().offset` is hard-coded to `0` before
 * measurement (`TickerItem.mjs`: `if ((!start && !end) || !listSize) return 0`).
 * So every function below returns a finite number for EVERY input, including
 * `NaN`, `Infinity`, `-Infinity` and `undefined`, and every one degrades to a
 * visible, unscaled, unmoved card rather than to a hidden or collapsed one.

/**
 * Whether THIS DOM copy of an item takes part in the entrance unfurl.

 * ## Why the gate is position-based and not `isClone`
 *
 * Ticker resolves `offset === 0` to `renderedOffset = -(totalItemLength + gap)`,
 * one whole loop period ABOVE the list. Which copy that leaves in the scrollport
 * depends entirely on the clone count:
 *
 * - No clones (scrollport shorter than one period): every ORIGINAL's projection
 *   fires, so the originals sit at their laid-out positions and fill the port.
 * - One or more clones: the originals are reprojected a full period BELOW the
 *   port and the first CLONE group occupies it instead.
 *
 * Measured in-browser at `viewportHeight` 720: the eight clone cards sat at
 * `y=0, opacity=1, scale=1` for every frame of the 600ms unfurl while the eight
 * originals ran the entire animation 592px below the port — a completely
 * invisible entrance. With `entranceOrigin="top"` it was worse: the originals
 * piled up at opacity 0.37 INSIDE the port, smearing translucent ghost cards
 * over the settled clones.
 *
 * Clone-ness is a DOM-ordering accident; occupancy is the real question. It
 * stays the right discriminator for `inert`/`aria-hidden` (a DOM-identity
 * concern) and the wrong one for the fan.
 *
 * `cardTop` is the card's laid-out top edge in SCROLLPORT coordinates
 * (`useCardTop()` plus the container's `inset`). Every copy with pixels on
 * screen fans, which is the whole point; {@link fanSlack} widens the window
 * past the edges only while the loop period exceeds the scrollport, and
 * anything it admits out there is clipped by the scrollport anyway — so a
 * second copy of the same item joining the fan can never be seen.
 *
 * Fails ANIMATED (`true`) for non-finite input and before measurement, so a
 * card can never be silently frozen out of its own entrance.

 *
 * ## Why this cannot be the static item index
 *
 * The obvious ladder is `itemIndex` (and `itemCount - 1 - itemIndex` for the
 * mirror), which is what this function used to return. It is wrong on a list
 * that LOOPS. The index ladder climbs `0 … itemCount - 1` and then RESETS,
 * while the cards themselves keep marching in one direction forever — so once
 * per loop period the last item reprojects above the first and the pair paints
 * inverted, one adjacent seam per period, exactly where the depth tail has made
 * the two cards overlap. Clones make it worse: they are separate `<li>`
 * siblings in the same stacking context and the index ladder gives a clone the
 * same rung as the original it copies.
 *
 * `loopPosition` is `start + projection` — see `use-card-top.ts` for why that
 * is the cheap, tie-free way to ask for a card's live loop ORDER. It is
 * monotonic across the wrap by construction: reprojecting a card adds a whole
 * `listSize` to it, which lifts it past every copy that has not reprojected
 * yet, instead of resetting it to zero.
 *
 * The two orders stay EXACT mirrors: `first-on-top` returns
 * `2 * STACK_LADDER_SPAN_PX` minus what `last-on-top` returns, so their sum is
 * the same constant for every card and every position.
 *
 * Returns `0` for a non-finite position, which puts the card at the bottom of
 * the stack rather than dropping it out of the paint order.

/**
 * How far a card has travelled into an edge zone, signed by which edge.
 *
 * Positive is the bottom edge, negative the top, `0` means the card is in open
 * space and the depth tail is inactive. The magnitude runs `0` at the zone
 * boundary through `1` at the scrollport edge.
 *
 * Deliberately a bare number rather than a `{ progress, edge }` record: this
 * runs inside a Motion `useTransform` on every animation frame for every card,
 * and Motion's own performance guidance is to avoid allocating in frame
 * callbacks. The sign carries the edge for free.
 *
 * `centre` is the card's midpoint in scrollport coordinates: `0` is the top of
 * the scrollport's content box and `containerLength` its bottom.
 *
 * ## Where `centre` must come from
 *
 * Compose it from {@link cardTopFrom} via the `useCardTop()` bridge in
 * `use-card-top.ts`, as `cardTop + cardHeight / 2 + inset`.
 *
 * Do NOT compose it inline from `useTickerItem()` as `offset + (end - start) /
 * 2`, even though `offset` is Ticker's own live top edge and the arithmetic is
 * identical. Ticker's `offset` is a motion 12 `MotionValue` while this package
 * imports motion 13, and reading one inside the zero-argument
 * `useTransform(() => …)` DOES NOT SUBSCRIBE: dependency collection runs
 * through motion-dom's module-level `collectMotionValues` singleton, and a
 * motion 12 `.get()` registers with motion-dom 12's copy, which motion-dom 13
 * never reads. The transform then recomputes only when some motion 13 value it
 * also touched changes, and freezes silently the moment that value settles.
 * That is not hypothetical — it is the exact bug that froze the whole depth
 * tail once the entrance landed, and it is why the crossing is done by hand,
 * once, with `.on("change", …)` in `use-card-top.ts`.
 *
 * The explicit `useTransform([value], fn)` form would subscribe correctly but
 * does not typecheck across the two nominally distinct `MotionValue` classes.
 * The bridge is the only supported route.
 *
 * With `depth: "both"` the zones overlap on a scrollport shorter than
 * `2 * zonePx`; the nearer edge wins so a card never fights two tucks at once.
 *
 * Returns `0` for any non-finite input, for `depth: "none"`, and before
 * measurement — the card stays full size and unmoved.
